# SafeCap Base Network Deployment Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide walks through deploying SafeCap's optimized smart contracts to Base Sepolia (testnet) and Base Mainnet with single NFT strategy.

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **2 signatures** instead of 6 (67% reduction)
- ‚úÖ **Single NFT** approach (simple, proven UX)
- ‚úÖ **Permissionless** campaign creation
- ‚úÖ **Base L2** ultra-low fees (~$0.01-0.05 per donation)

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Node.js installed (v16-20 recommended, not v23)
- [ ] Private key configured in `.env` file
- [ ] Hardhat configuration includes Base networks
- [ ] All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### 2. Network Configuration Verification
```bash
# Verify hardhat.config.js includes:
networks: {
  "base-sepolia": {
    url: "https://sepolia.base.org",
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
    chainId: 84532,
    gasPrice: 1000000000 // 1 gwei
  },
  base: {
    url: "https://mainnet.base.org",
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY], 
    chainId: 8453,
    gasPrice: "auto"
  }
}
```

### 3. Contract Compilation
- [ ] All optimized contracts compiled successfully
- [ ] ABI files generated in `artifacts/` directory
- [ ] No compilation errors or warnings

## üöÄ Base Sepolia Deployment (Testnet)

### Step 1: Fund Deployer Wallet

**Deployer Address**: `0xFd638308290BD73ab40F1C04d9EB9c1e93525c31`

**Get Base Sepolia ETH:**
1. Go to: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-sepolia-faucet
2. Enter wallet address: `0xFd638308290BD73ab40F1C04d9EB9c1e93525c31`
3. Request 0.5 ETH (more than enough for deployment)
4. Wait for confirmation (~1-2 minutes)

### Step 2: Verify Wallet Balance

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.js --network base-sepolia
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üí∞ Checking wallet balance for deployment
=========================================
Wallet address: 0xFd638308290BD73ab40F1C04d9EB9c1e93525c31
Current balance: 0.5 ETH
Estimated deployment cost: 0.002 ETH
Gas price: 1.0 gwei
‚úÖ Sufficient balance for deployment
üí° Ready to deploy optimized contracts!
```

### Step 3: Deploy Optimized Contracts (2 Signatures)

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-optimized.js --network base-sepolia
```

**Expected Process:**
1. **Signature 1**: Deploy Registry + Factory + NFT contracts
2. **Signature 2**: Initialize registry connections
3. **Automatic**: Create sample campaign for testing

**Expected Output:**
```
üöÄ OPTIMIZED DEPLOYMENT PROCESS
===============================
Reducing from 6 signatures to 2 signatures

üìù SIGNATURE 1: Deploying Registry + Factory + NFT contracts
   Deploying CampaignRegistry...
   ‚úÖ Registry deployed to: 0x[ADDRESS]
   Deploying OptimizedCampaignFactory...
   ‚úÖ Factory deployed to: 0x[ADDRESS]
   Deploying UniversalCampaignNFT...
   ‚úÖ NFT deployed to: 0x[ADDRESS]

üìù SIGNATURE 2: Initialize registry connections
   ‚úÖ Registry initialized successfully!

üß™ Testing permissionless campaign creation...
   ‚úÖ Sample campaign created at: 0x[ADDRESS]

   Factory:   0x[FACTORY_ADDRESS]
   NFT:       0x[NFT_ADDRESS]
   Campaign:  0x[CAMPAIGN_ADDRESS]

üíæ Deployment data saved to optimized-deployment.json
```

### Step 4: Test Deployment Functionality

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/test-optimized-donation.js --network base-sepolia
```

**Expected Tests:**
- ‚úÖ Permissionless campaign creation
- ‚úÖ ETH donations and NFT minting
- ‚úÖ Campaign progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Batch campaign creation
- ‚úÖ Registry validation
- ‚úÖ NFT metadata and tracking

**Expected Output:**
```
üß™ Testing optimized SafeCap deployment
=====================================

   ‚úÖ Campaign registered in registry: true

2Ô∏è‚É£ Testing campaign donations and NFT minting
   ‚úÖ Donation successful!
   ‚úÖ NFT correctly minted to donor

3Ô∏è‚É£ Testing campaign progress tracking
   Current amount: 0.01 ETH
   Goal amount: 0.1 ETH
   Progress: 10%

‚úÖ OPTIMIZED SAFECAP TESTING COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

### Step 5: Verify Contracts on Block Explorer

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-optimized.js --network base-sepolia
```

**Note**: Block explorer verification may not be available immediately on Base Sepolia. This step may show warnings but is not critical for functionality.

### Step 6: Document Deployment Results

**Record the following from deployment output:**
- [ ] Registry Address: `0x...`
- [ ] Factory Address: `0x...`
- [ ] NFT Address: `0x...`
- [ ] Sample Campaign Address: `0x...`
- [ ] Transaction Hashes for both signatures
- [ ] Total gas used and cost in ETH

**Update Configuration Files:**
```typescript
// safecap-mono/apps/admin/src/web3/contractAddresses.ts
baseSepolia: {
  registry: "0x[REGISTRY_ADDRESS]",
  factory: "0x[FACTORY_ADDRESS]",
  nft: "0x[NFT_ADDRESS]"
}
```

## üéØ Base Mainnet Deployment (Production)

### Pre-Production Checklist

**Before mainnet deployment, ensure:**
- [ ] Base Sepolia deployment working perfectly
- [ ] All tests passing on testnet
- [ ] Frontend integration tested on testnet
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Team approval for mainnet deployment
- [ ] Sufficient ETH for mainnet gas fees

### Step 1: Fund Mainnet Wallet

**Get Base ETH for mainnet:**
- Purchase ETH on exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
- Bridge to Base network using official Base bridge
- **Estimated needed**: 0.01 ETH ($25-50 depending on ETH price)

### Step 2: Verify Mainnet Balance

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-balance.js --network base
```

### Step 3: Deploy to Base Mainnet

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-optimized.js --network base
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This deploys to production and costs real money!

### Step 4: Test Mainnet Deployment

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/test-optimized-donation.js --network base
```

**Use small amounts for testing (0.001 ETH donations)**

### Step 5: Verify Mainnet Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-optimized.js --network base
```

### Step 6: Configure Production Settings

**Set Creation Fee (Optional Revenue Generation):**
```bash
npx hardhat console --network base

# In console:
const factory = await ethers.getContractAt("OptimizedCampaignFactory", "0x[FACTORY_ADDRESS]")

# Set small creation fee (example: $0.50 worth of ETH)
await factory.setCreationFee(ethers.parseEther("0.0005"))

# Verify fee was set
const fee = await factory.campaignCreationFee()
console.log("Creation fee:", ethers.formatEther(fee), "ETH")
```

**Update Production Configuration:**
```typescript
// safecap-mono/apps/admin/src/web3/contractAddresses.ts
base: {
  registry: "0x[MAINNET_REGISTRY_ADDRESS]",
  factory: "0x[MAINNET_FACTORY_ADDRESS]",
  nft: "0x[MAINNET_NFT_ADDRESS]"
}
```

---

## üìä Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Revenue Collection (Your Income)

**Check collected fees:**
```bash
npx hardhat console --network base
const factory = await ethers.getContractAt("OptimizedCampaignFactory", "0x[FACTORY_ADDRESS]")
const balance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(factory.address)
console.log("Collected fees:", ethers.formatEther(balance), "ETH")
```

**Withdraw fees to your wallet:**
```bash
# In hardhat console
await factory.withdrawFees("0x[YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS]")
```

### Platform Analytics

**Monitor key metrics:**
- Total campaigns created: `await registry.getCampaignCount()`
- NFTs minted: `await nft.getTotalNFTs()`
- Platform usage and growth
- Average donation amounts
- User satisfaction and support tickets

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue**: "Insufficient funds for gas"
**Solution**: Add more ETH to deployer wallet

**Issue**: "Network not responding"  
**Solution**: Check internet connection, try different RPC endpoint

**Issue**: "Contract verification failed"
**Solution**: Verification is optional, contracts still work

**Issue**: "Transaction reverted during testing"
**Solution**: Check if sample campaign was created successfully, may be due to duplicate testing

**Documentation:**
- [Base Network Docs](https://docs.base.org/)
