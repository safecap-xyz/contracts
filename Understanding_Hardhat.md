## Understanding Your Hardhat Configuration
Your current hardhat.config.js is set up with:

1. Network configurations for:
   
   - Local Hardhat network
   - Sepolia testnet
   - Base testnet (Goerli)
2. Gas reporting and coverage configurations
## Working with Hardhat Commands
To better understand your contracts and their functions, here are some useful commands:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
 ```

This will compile all your contracts and generate artifacts in the artifacts directory.

```bash
npx hardhat test
 ```

This runs your test suite to verify contract functionality.

```bash
npx hardhat node
 ```

This starts a local Ethereum node for development.

## Exploring Contract Functions
To see all available functions in your contracts, you can use:

```bash
npx hardhat flatten
 ```

Or to get a more detailed view of a specific contract:

```bash
npx hardhat console
 ```

Then in the console:

```javascript
const Contract = await ethers.getContractFactory("YourContractName")
console.log(Object.keys(Contract.interface.functions))
 ```

## Deployment Workflow
For deploying to testnets:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
 ```

Or for Base testnet:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network base_testnet
 ```

## Verifying Contracts
After deployment, you can verify your contracts on Etherscan:

```bash
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS constructor_argument1 constructor_argument2
 ```
```

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of your Hardhat setup or contract interactions in more detail?
